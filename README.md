## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say _"[Field Name] cannot be empty"_
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say _"Looks like this is not an email"_

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Bootstrap] (https://getbootstrap.com/) - Bootstrap framework

### What I learned

Good things during the project

- I've also build in this project a good HTML markup within a few hours
- In my opinion i wrote structured CSS-files with a bunch of useful variables
- The first time ever i've used more than one CSS-file and added indexes to them for a better structur
- I was persistent and worked on the project even there were heavy parts/days
- For the layout i needed to focus on flexbox and flexbox properties and so I learned more about it
- It was my first challenge where I was forced to work with JS and I learned a lot about the basics. I was able to practice theoretical approaches like objects and instances.

Doesn't match my expectations

- I really thought I can safe handle flexbox but I further need more practice.
- I felt really uncomfortable with js and I recognized that I need to focus on learning js fast as I can.
